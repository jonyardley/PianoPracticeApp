# Crux Counter Example

The Crux Counter example is a simple multi-platform application that calls a cloud-hosted API.

It makes HTTP requests to a shared global counter hosted at [https://crux-counter.fly.dev](https://crux-counter.fly.dev), incrementing or decrementing the counter value.

The [server](./server/) also has an endpoint for Server Sent Events ([https://crux-counter.fly.dev/sse](https://crux-counter.fly.dev/sse)), which signals when changes are made to the global counter value — so that when you update the counter in one client, all the other clients will update too.

We have included an example of a [Server Sent Events capability](./shared/src/capabilities/sse.rs), which uses the core's ability to stream responses from the shell.

### Notes:

1. Please make sure you have the following rust targets installed (there is a [`rust-toolchain.toml`](../../rust-toolchain.toml) in the root directory of this repo, so you should be able to type `rustup target list --installed`, in or below the root directory, and these targets will be installed if they are not already present).

   ```txt
   aarch64-apple-darwin
   aarch64-apple-ios
   aarch64-apple-ios-sim
   aarch64-linux-android
   wasm32-unknown-unknown
   x86_64-apple-ios
   ```

2. This example currently depends on the `pnpm` package manager when generating types for TypeScript. We are currently revisiting the type generation for foreign types and so this requirement will probably go, but for now, please [install `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation).

## Rust

1. Make sure the core builds

   ```sh
   cargo build --package shared
   ```

2. Generate the shared types for your client applications

   ```sh
   cargo build --package shared_types
   ```

## iOS

You will need XCode, which you can get in the Mac AppStore

```
cd iOS
open CounterApp.xcodeproj
```

You should be able to press "Play" to start the app in the simulator, or on an iPhone.

### Notes:

- You may encounter this error:

  ```
  xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
  ```

  If this happens, then you need to install the [Command Line Tools For Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/).
